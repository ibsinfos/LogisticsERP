<h3>Overview</h3>

ApricotRocket is a combination of a CRM Database integrated with an Email 
Marketing and Text Marketing system and includes a Marketing Automation process 
management capability. Designed to work seamlessly with Word Press by using this 
plugin the ApricotRocket system can also be easily integrated with any other 
website content management system.

We believe that we compete very well with top shelf systems such as InfusionSoft,
Salesforce, Marketo, Pardot, and HubSpot. We price our system competitively with
tools like ConstantContact, Mail Chimp, and Aweber.

We believe that it should not be terribly expensive to have a full featured
marketing automation system. In fact, we price our system at a level that we
think makes ApricotRocket the best value in the market. We hope you agree.

<h3>CRM Database</h3>

A Customer Relationship Management database is the core of our system. We have
designed the CRM Database to be incredibly intuitive and to have the most essential
data fields automatically included. Included is a simple classification process 
that allows you to assign each record to one of 6 separate Classes, each of which
can be customized with an unlimited number of class descriptions.

Three of these six standard Classes are what we call MOSS... multiple option
single select. Three of the six standard Classes are what we call MOMS... multiple
option multiple select.

Additionally, each CRM Database record can be classified according to a Sales
Funnel Stage. The Stages in the Sales Funnel can be customized... as many or
as few as you wish. Each record in your CRM Database can be assigned a Stage
in the Sales Funnel. As various Events occur you can change the Stage either
manually or automatically.

All information in the CRM Database can be downloaded at any time with a single
click. Downloads are generated as .csv files that you can store wherever you wish.
Your data is always yours and can be stored safely offsite anytime you wish.

<h3>Custom Forms</h3>

One of the best features is the ability to quickly create Custom Forms and easily
place them on your website. If you have a Word Press website you can use the
form shortcodes and simply copy and paste them to your Word Press website on any
page, post, or sidebar text widget. If you wish you can use the HTML <iFrame>
tag to insert Custom Forms on website pages other than Word Press websites.

Custom Forms can be created with any combination of CRM Data Fields inserted
into the Custom Form. This allows you to capture exactly the information you need
from your customers and prospects. You can fully customize the forms and change
the background colors, form border colors, text fonts, buton colors, and many 
aspects of the look and feel of your Custom Form.

You can create either Vertical or Horizontal forms. If you create a Horizontal
form you can decide if there is one, two, or three columns and you can place
specific Data Fields in each row and column to control placement. Then, again,
you can place the form on your website exactly where you want it by just copying
and pasting either a shortcode or an HTML code.

You do not need to know any HTML to create Custom Forms.

<h3>LogicGates</h3>

LogicGates are one of the features of ApricotRocket which make the system so
powerful. LogicGates allow you to create a form where you ask questions. Each
potential answer to the question you ask can be set up to send your visitor to 
a different next step. For example... if someone says that they are a Tall Man 
you can send them to the page where you offer clothes for Tall Men. If they are
a Petite Woman you can send them to a pager where you offer clothes for Petite
Women.

LogicGates are extremely simple to set up and, just like Custom Forms, you can
easily control all aspects of how the form looks. Also like Custom Forms,  you
do not need to have any special HTML or programming skills to create LogicGates
or to put them on your website.

<h3>Event Triggers</h3>

Event Triggers can be connected to either Custom Forms or to LogicGates. Event
Triggers allow you to respond to your customer or prospect other than simply 
sending them to another page or form. Event Triggers allow you to take specific
actions such as:
*   Send an Email to the Customer
*   Send an Email to yourself
*   Send a Text Message to the Customer
*   Send a Text Message to yourself
*   Start an Email Marketing Campaign to the Customer
*   Start a Text Messaging Campaig to the Customer
*   Send a Voice Mail Message to the Customer
*   Change data in the CRM Record for the Customer
*   All of the above in any combination

Event Triggers are also very simple to set up. You do not need any programming
skills or experience to create and use Event Triggers.

<h3>Email Newsletters</h3>

ApricotRocket creates beautiful emails and delivers them with great efficiency.

ApricotRocket offers a very intuitive and powerful Email Newsletter creation and
management system. Lots of Templates are provided to select from and it is easy
to take a Template and customize it with your own images and text and links. Once
you have created your newsletters you can connect them into a sequence of 
Email Campaigns. Email Newsletters and Email Campaigns can be sent to groups of
people in your CRM Database or they can be automatically sent using Event Triggers
based on the actions your visitors take when they fill out Custom Forms or
LogicGates.

Every message sent is tracked through our system and we show whether or not it was
delivered, opened, clicked, bounced, unsubscribed, or reported as spam. Our 
system automatically flags messages that are unsubscribed or reported as spam and
you do not have to worry about removing them. We automatically take care of this
for you. Our statistics programming is very intuitive and comprehensive.

When someone clicks on a link in an Email you know who and if you want to we can
send you an email or a text message when this happens. Also, when they click on
a link you can use the Email Click Trigger system just like the Event Trigger to
do the same things that Event Triggers can do.

<h3>Custom Data Fields</h3>

No CRM Database comes out of the box with all of the data fields that every
business needs. Each business is unique and while we have a lot of standard data
fields we also make it very easy and intuitive for you to create new data fields
and add them to your CRM Database. Create as many new data fields as you need for
your business.

After you create new data fields you can select them when you create a new Custom
Form. This makes it very easy for you to create truly Custom Forms designed 
specifically for your business. When someone fills out a Custom Form the 
information you collect goes directly into your database. Seamlessly integrated
and without any hassle. This is the easiest way to manage your data that there
is anywhere.

Once you have added new data fields they show up automatically in the Search
process. This means that you can immediately start searching your CRM Database
for exactly the customers that you need to find.

<h3>Pricing</h3>

We are proud of our pricing system. 

<h3>Free up to 100</h3>

We offer everything (except SMS Text Messaging) free to anyone using 
ApricotRocket for FREE... up to a database of 100 records. The reason that we
cannot include SMS Text Messaging is that we incur a delivery charge for each
message and therefore we cannot include SMS Text Messaging on the FREE accounts.

All of the other features are available for free... just like for any of our 
Upgraded clients.

<h3>60 Day Money Back Guarantee</h3>

We also offer a 60 Day Money Back Guarantee. This means that when you decide to
Upgrade to one of our Paid Subscription Levels you have the confidence of knowing
that if you ever decide to quit you can request the last 2 monthly fees as a 
refund if you wish.

We trust that our clients will love our system and we place our trust in our
software. If it is not something that you feel was worth your investment we do
not want to take your money. Simple. No questions asked... just fill out a form
on our system requesting a refund and we will cancel your account and refund 
your last 2 payments.

<h3>Upgrade Options</h3>

We offer a variety of Upgrade Options. When you reach a limit you can simply 
to the next level and pay the fee. If your database reaches a limit you will be 
unable to add new records either by uploading records or by people filling out
a form on your website. We send you notifications when this is the case so that
you can upgrade and avoid loosing out on growing your database.

<h3>Email and SMS Text Limits</h3>

We do offer a limit on the # of emails you can send and the # of sms text messages
that you can send each month. The reason is that we incur costs for the delivery
of these messages and we have to make sure that we are covering our costs. We
are sure that you understand.

<h3>Support</h3>

We have built our system to be incredibly intuitive. In fact, we think that it
may be the most intuitive Marketing Automation tool on the market today.

<h3>Video Tutorials</h3>

If you are using the Free service we provide you with a growing library of video
tutorials that we have created to try and cover every aspect of the system that
we think you may need some help with.

<h3>Client Support Options</h3>

If you are a Paying Client we are delighted to answer your questions by either
email or phone. Phone support is limited to the hours of 8-5pm Central Time. 
Email support is available 24 - 7 and we typically respond within a few minutes 
to a few hours.

Our Phone Support # is 214-772-6854.

Q: How many Emails can I send?
A: You can send a maximum of 6 emails per month times the Max # or CRM Records for your Account.

   *   Free Accounts have a Maximum of 100 Records so the Maximum # of Emails / Month for a Free Account is 600 emails.
   *   Upgrade Level 1 Account have a Maximum of 400 Records so the Maximum # of Emails / Month would be 2,400 emails.
   *   Note: You could send all 2400 emails to a single Record (bad idea) or you could send 1,200 emails each to 2 Records (also a bad idea).
